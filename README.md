Find a never-extracted sequence for SuperEnalotto. Without any reason, it will work. 

- [ ] Grab all the extracted sequence since 1997
- [ ] Save the sequence in a CSV file
- [ ] Insert the sequence in an indexed structure. We want to know if a seuqence exists, and how many times it has been extracted
- [ ] Write a CSV with the sequences ordered by how many times have been extracted
- [ ] Find a sequence that has never been extracted
